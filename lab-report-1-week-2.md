# Lab Report 1
Hello, incoming CSE 15L student (or future me)! <br/>
My name is Stephanie and I will be in charge of getting your course specific account on **ieng6** - the UCSD server that you, as a CSE student, have access to - set up. My credentials are that I myself have successfully been through this process... a week ago... and I did encounter ~~quite a few~~ multiple obstacles along the way, so I pray to god this will go smoothly for you. <br/>
<br/>
Here is an outline of the steps detailed on this page:
1. [Installing VScode](#step-1)
2. [Remotely Connecting](#step-2)
3. [Trying Some Commands](#step-3)
4. [Moving Files with scp](#step-4)
5. [Setting an SSH Key](#step-5)
6. [Optimizing Remote Running](#step-6)
