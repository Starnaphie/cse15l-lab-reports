# Lab Report 1
Hello, incoming CSE 15L student (or future me)! <br/>
My name is Stephanie and I will be in charge of getting your course specific account on **ieng6** - the UCSD server that you, as a CSE student, have access to - set up. My credentials are that I myself have successfully been through this process... less than a week ago... and I did encounter ~~several~~ a higher-than-average number of obstacles along the way, but hopefully that will be sufficient. 

Here is an outline of the steps detailed on this page:
1. [Installing VScode](#step-1)
2. [Remotely Connecting](#step-2)
3. [Trying Some Commands](#step-3)
4. [Moving Files with scp](#step-4)
5. [Setting an SSH Key](#step-5)
6. [Optimizing Remote Running](#step-6)

Now, let's get you ready for this class!

## <a name="step-1"></a> Installing VScode 
**Disclaimer**: VScode is the IDE the professor will be using in this class, so downloading it would make lectures and tutorials easier to follow, but you *can* use another IDE. Getting VScode is still highly recommended.

Just like another other app, installing VScode just takes a quick Google search. In fact, because it has the sweet quality of being *free*, we don't even need to pirate it. 
Going to **[this](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** link should take you to a page with the following screen.

From here, download the file that corresponds with your operating system and click the buttons any system pop-ups ask you to click. With that, VScode should be installed (if not please contact your professor or TA).<br/>
The coming steps will mostly be done using the VScode terminal, so, to set that up, open up VScode. Doing so should take you to a screen similar to this:

On MacOS, you can access the terminal with ctrl + upArrow + ` or by going to the app's menu bar and clicking ```New Terminal```.

If you have an operating system that is not MacOs -> professor or TA ;D

## <a name="step-2"></a> Remotely Connecting
Part 1 of step 2 will be the only part of the remainder of this tutorial not in VScode. Before remotely connecting to **ieng6**, you will need to set up your course-specific account. 

You can go to **[this](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)** link to get that done. This was the step I personally had the most difficulty with, so I will try to give some tips. 
- Get this step done before class, because everyone trying to sign into the acccount lookup at the same time is hard on the server
- The password requirements are as follows:
    - Be different from any previous passwords
    - Be at least 12 characters long
    - Include characters from at least 3 of the following 4 categories: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
    - Not contain any part of your username<br/>
- If things aren't loading, go to #1; if prolonged, go to #2<br/>
If things aren't functioning correctly, go to #2
    1. Wait
    2. **Contact professor or TA**

Part 2 will be establishing the remote connection.
